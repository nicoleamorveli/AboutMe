# About me

Hello! I am a biotech engineer with a minor in molecular biology. I am a peruvian currently living in Mexico. 

My history 

I started programming during the career but I was not really into it. It was until 2020 while I was doing a research internship in Brigham and Women's Hospital & Harvard Medical School when I realized that bioinformatics was my thing. 

First things first, the research I was doing was about kidney fibrosis. In general terms, we were trying to elucidate the molecular role of  a gene in fibrosis. We were doing that by using cell culture techniques. In particular, we created a knock out (KO) and a overexpressing (IOE) cell lines for our gene. We used those cell lines to perform the experiments. The data we handled was a qualitative. But, one year ago, my advisor carried a mass spectrometry experiment and got the protemic data of the KO, IOE and wild type. 

Well, I will get to the point. During pandemic, the lab was closed. As I was confined in my house, boredom started doing its thing and a as result I started looking into the protemic data. I started watching some clasess (mit openware) in youtube about computational biology. I was fascinated by the analysis carry out using programming tools. So, I decided to analyse my data. I did not have much experience so the analysis was not that good. My main goal was to predict which cellular pathway was being affected by the overexpression of the gene by using the protemic data values and comparing them to the wild type. As I said, i did not suceed completely but I managed to create two posible cellular pathways which involed AKT pathway and glutamine metabolism. 
By using this information we tried it in our celullar model and it had very interesting results. 

And that was my first direct contact with bioinformatics. After my research internship I was very interested in learning how to code and the data analysis behind that. After graduating I started working a biotech company were I got the chance to analyze mass spectrometry data. Also I am currently doing a applied statistics diploma where we focus on data analysis. 

As for programming I learned to code in phyton (thanks udemy) and I developed this code. This idea poped out during a conversation with my sister, a physican. She told that fellows in order to graduate need to do clinical study and many times they struggle with the statistical analysis. So I proposed her to create a code where they can paste their data and will create a report in latex which they can later use. 

My goals 

So that is me. I am currently very interested in learning more  about data analysis with R studio and other programming tools. Eventually I want to do a master degree in bioinformatics and focus in protein curation. Right now, I am working full time but I want to work as a freelance for statistical analysis. 

If anyone is interested in learning biotechnology or sharing knowledge do not hesitate in contacting me :D.
