# 👋 Hi, I'm Nicole

## 🎓 Background
I recently graduated with an MSc in **Bioinformatics** from the University of Bristol, after completing a BSc in **Biotechnology Engineering**. Originally from **Peru**, I have always been passionate about the intersection of biology and technology. Specifically, I focus on **proteomics** and **protein structure prediction**.

## 🧬 My Work
My research interests lie in **computational chemistry** and automating bioinformatics pipelines. For my Master's thesis (available in this repository), I worked on:

- **Project**: *Searching for Diels-Alder homologs using Foldseek*.
- **Objective**: Predicting their closed structure.
- **Tech Stack**: I developed and automated the pipeline using **Python** and **Bash**.

The tools and scripts in the repository are aimed at making this search process efficient and reproducible. 

## 🔬 PhD Aspirations
Through my work, I uncovered some **black boxes** in current protein structure prediction tools like **AlphaFold**. This discovery has inspired me to pursue a **PhD** focused on improving protein structure prediction, with the goal of developing more interpretable and accurate computational methods.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, Bash, R
- **Bioinformatics Tools**: Foldseek, AlphaFold, BLAST
- **Areas of Interest**: Computational Chemistry, Proteomics, Structural Biology, Automation

Let's collaborate on exciting projects! Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out to me if you'd like to connect!
